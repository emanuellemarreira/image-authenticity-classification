## Architecture

- ### ResNet50
    
    ResNet50 is a 50-layer deep convolutional neural network from the ResNet
    family (Residual Networks), widely used in image classification and feature extraction. The architecture of ResNet50 is divided into four main parts: the convolutional layers, the identity block, the convolutional block, and the fully connected layers. The convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features from the input image, while the identity block and convolutional block are responsible for processing and transforming these features. Finally, the fully connected layers are used to make the final classification.

- ### MobileNetV2

    MobileNetV2 is an improved version of the original MobileNet architecture, designed specifically for efficient deep learning on mobile and embedded devices. 
    t is based on an inverted residual structure where the residual connections are between the bottleneck layers. The intermediate expansion layer uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features as a source of non-linearity. As a whole, the architecture of MobileNetV2 contains the initial fully convolution layer with 32 filters, followed by 19 residual bottleneck layers.
